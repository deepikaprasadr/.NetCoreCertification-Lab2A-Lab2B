    What is Routing in ASP.NET Core?
    Routing in ASP.NET Core is the process of matching incoming HTTP requests to controller actions and determining which action should handle the request. It plays a vital role in URL mapping and directing requests to the appropriate endpoints. The ASP.NET Core routing system uses route templates to define patterns for URLs.

    Key components of routing in ASP.NET Core
    Route Template: A route template defines the structure of a URL and includes placeholders for route values. For example, /products/{id} is a route template with a placeholder {id}.
    Route Values: Route values are extracted from the URL based on the placeholders defined in the route template. In the above example, id is a route value.
    Route Constraints: Constraints are used to restrict which URLs match a route template. For instance, you can constrain id to only match numeric values.



    Using areas creates a hierarchy for the purpose of routing by adding another route parameter, area , to controller and
    action or a Razor Page page . Areas provide a way to partition an ASP.NET Core Web app into smaller functional groups,
    each with its own set of Razor Pages, controllers, views, and models.    Route Parameters: Route parameters are placeholders
    in controller action methods that correspond to route values. They receive values from the route values extracted from the URL
